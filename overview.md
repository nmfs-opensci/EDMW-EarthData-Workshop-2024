The the era of big data in the earth sciences is here and learning how to effectively use oceanographic remote-sensing data, both in the cloud and on your computer, is a core skill for modern fisheries science and management. Learning how to access cloud-based data, visualize these data, use these data in models, and use the tools of modern reproducible and collaborative science is the main goal of this course. Through the course, participants will gain experience with assessing remote-sensing data in the cloud, R and RStudio, Python and Jupyter notebooks, and collaborating with Git and GitHub.

## Aims and Objectives

* Learn how to discover and use oceanographic remote-sensing data for species distribution modeling and other fisheries applications
* Familiarize participants with using remote-sensing data and geospatial tools in R and Python code.
* Obtain hands-on experience in using remote-sensing data and other earth data in science workflows by working together on a group project.

## What is a hackweek?

*A hackweek is a participant-driven workshop that blends data science education, community building, and project work over a short period of time (one to two weeks). The events are highly immersive and allow participants to work directly with data science professionals to co-shape projects and educational outcomes. Hackweeks help individuals and teams engage more effectively in open and reproducible science.* - [eScience Institute](https://escience.washington.edu/using-data-science/hackweeks/), University of Washington, Seattle USA

[The hackweek model](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1717196115)  has become a vital tool in the data science community, fostering idea exchange through modern data analysis workflow training. Unlike traditional academic events, hackweeks offer intensive, interactive learning, including tutorials on cutting-edge methods, peer-based learning, and collaborative on-site projects. Unlike hackathons, which emphasize software development, hackweeks prioritize education and open-ended projects, benefiting fields needing both expertise and efficient computational workflows for idea exchange and discovery. The hackweek model is now widely used in many fields: [Astrohackweek](http://astrohackweek.org),
[Neurohackweek](https://neurohackweek.github.io), [Geohackweek](https://geohackweek.github.io), [OceanHackWeek](https://oceanhackweek.github.io), [ICESat-2 Hackweek](https://icesat-2-2023.hackweek.io/), [SnowEx Hackweek](https://snowex.hackweek.io/), [NASA Cloud Hackathon](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/). The NOAA HackDays content and format is modeled off the University of Washington [eScience Hackweek model](https://escience.washington.edu/using-data-science/hackweeks/).

## Code of Conduct 

The NOAA HackDays events are a safe learning space and all participants are required to abide by our [Code of Conduct](coc.html).

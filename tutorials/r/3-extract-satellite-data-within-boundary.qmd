## Summary

In this example, we will utilize the `earthdatalogin` R package to retrieve sea surface temperature data from [NASA Earthdata search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search). The `earthdatalogin` R package simplifies the process of discovering and accessing NASA Earth science data.

This example is adapted from the NOAA CoastWatch Satellite Data Tutorials. To explore the full range of tutorials on accessing and utilizing oceanographic satellite data, visit the [NOAA CoastWatch Tutorial Github repository.](https://github.com/coastwatch-training/CoastWatch-Tutorials)

For more on `earthdatalogin` visit the [`earthdatalogin` GitHub](https://github.com/boettiger-lab/earthdatalogin/) page and/or the [`earthdatalogin` documentation](https://boettiger-lab.github.io/earthdatalogin/) site. Be aware that `earthdatalogin` is under active development and that we are using the development version on GitHub.

## Terminology

- **`shapefiles`**: is a simple, nontopological format for storing the geometric location and attribute information of geographic features. Geographic features in a shapefile can be represented by points, lines, or polygons (areas). Learn more [here](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/shapefiles/what-is-a-shapefile.htm). 

## Prerequisites

The tutorials today can be run with the guest Earthdata Login that is in `earthdatalogin`. 
However, if you will be using the NASA Earthdata portal more regularly, please register for an 
Earthdata Login account. Please <https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov> to register and manage your 
Earthdata Login account. This account is free to create and only takes a moment to set up.

### Import Required Packages

*Note: See the set-up tab (in left nav bar) for instructions on getting set up on your own computer, but
be aware that getting it is common to run into trouble getting GDAL set up properly to handle
netCDF files. Using a Docker image (and Python) is often less aggravating.*

## Datasets used

**GHRSST Level 4 AVHRR_OI Global Blended Sea Surface Temperature Analysis (GDS2) from NCEI**\
This NOAA blended SST is a moderate resolution satellite-based gap-free sea surface temperature (SST) product. We will use the daily data. https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C2036881712-POCLOUD.html

**Longhurst Marine Provinces**\
The dataset represents the division of the world oceans into provinces as defined by Longhurst (1995; 1998; 2006). This division has been based on the prevailing role of physical forcing as a regulator of phytoplankton distribution.

The Longhurst Marine Provinces dataset is available online (https://www.marineregions.org/downloads.php) and within the shapes folder associated with this repository. For this exercise we will use the Gulf Stream province (`ProvCode: GFST`)

## Load packages

```{r message=FALSE}
library(terra)
library(earthdatalogin)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Load boundary coordinates

The shapefile for the Longhurst marine provinces includes a list of regions.\
For this exercise, we will only use the boundary of one province, the Gulf Stream region ("GFST").

```{r read_province_boundaries}
# Set directory path for shapefile
dir_path <- '../resources/longhurst_v4_2010/'

# Import shape files (Longhurst coordinates)
shapes <- read_sf(dsn = dir_path, layer = "Longhurst_world_v4_2010")

# Example List of all the province names
shapes$ProvCode

# Get boundary coordinates for Gulf Stream region (GFST)
GFST <- shapes[shapes$ProvCode == "GFST",]

xcoord <- st_coordinates(GFST)[,1]
ycoord <- st_coordinates(GFST)[,2]
```

## Search data from NASA Earthdata with the dataset unique name and coordinates/dates

First, connect to NASA Earthdata with no credentials

```{r}
earthdatalogin::edl_netrc()
```

Then, define your search and cropping criteria

```{r get_results}
# Dataset unique name
short_name <- 'AVHRR_OI-NCEI-L4-GLOB-v2.1'

# Set boundaries based on the shapefile
bbox <- c(xmin=min(xcoord), ymin=min(ycoord), xmax=max(xcoord), ymax=max(ycoord)) 

# Set time range
tbox <- c("2020-01-01", "2020-04-01")

# Search data that match the boundaries and time range
results <- edl_search(
  short_name = short_name,
  version = "2.1",
  temporal = tbox,
  bounding_box = paste(bbox, collapse = ",")
)

# Check number of files 
length(results)
```

There are `r length(results)` files.

## Apply shapefiles as mask to satellite data

```{r get_first_result}
# Select the first result
ras <- terra::rast(results[1], vsi = TRUE)

# Extract SST from the multi-layer raster data
ras_sst <- ras[["analysed_sst"]]

# Vectorize shapes
shp <- vect(shapes)

# Get boundaries for GFST
GFST <- shp[shp$ProvCode == "GFST",]
```

Plot the SST data.
```{r plot_SST}
plot(ras_sst)
```

Plot GFST boundaries from shapefile.
```{r plot_GFST}
plot(GFST,col='red')
```

Mask SST with the GFST boundaries and plot.
```{r mask_SST}
masked_rc <- mask(ras_sst, GFST)

# Visualize the SST in GFST Province and crop to the GFST extent
plot(masked_rc, ext = GFST)
```

## Compute monthly average of SST

We will construct a data cube to compute monthly average for sea surface temperature data within the boundary.
To minimize data loading times, the first 10 results, which correspond to approximately two months 
of data, will be used for this exercise.

Select the first 10 SST results (end of January and beginning of February). 
```{r get_first_ten}
ras_all <- terra::rast(results[c(25:35)], vsi = TRUE)
```

Trim the SST data to the boundaries of GFST. 
```{r trim_to_boundary}
rc_all <- terra::mask(ras_all, GFST)
```

Select SST data. 
```{r select_sst}
rc_sst <- rc_all["analysed_sst", ]
```

Calculate mean SST over the entire time series and map it
```{r get_means}

# Compute mean over 12 time layers
raster_mean <- terra::mean(rc_sst, na.rm=TRUE)

# Map mean SST 
plot(raster_mean)

# Map only the GFST area
plot(terra::crop(raster_mean, GFST))


```


Calculate monthly mean SST means across raster (lat, lon). 
```{r get_monthly_means}

# Function to convert times to year-month format
year_month <- function(x) {
  format(as.Date(time(x), format="%Y-%m-%d"), "%Y-%m")
}

# Format time to Year-month for monthly aggregation 
ym <- year_month(rc_sst)

# Compute raster mean grouped by Year-month
monthly_mean_rast <- terra::tapp(rc_sst, ym, fun = mean)

# Compute mean across raster grouped by Year-month
monthly_means <- terra::global(monthly_mean_rast, fun = mean, na.rm=TRUE)

```


## Convert raster into data frame

```{r ras_to_df}
# Convert raster into data.frame
monthly_means_df <- as.data.frame(monthly_means)

# Convert year_month to a column
monthly_means_df$year_month <- sub("X", "", rownames(monthly_means_df))
```

## Plot monthly mean of sea surface temperature within GFST province

```{r plot_monthly_mean}
ggplot(data = monthly_means_df, aes(x = year_month, y = mean, group = 1)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Year.Month") + 
  ylab("Mean SST (F)")
```

## Troubleshooting

::: {.callout-note title="Troubleshooting"}
If you get the following error:

> Warning: Opening a /vsi file with the netCDF driver requires Linux userfaultfd to be available. Or you may set the GDAL_SKIP=netCDF configuration option to force the use of the HDF5 driver. (GDAL error 1)Error: [rast] file does not exist: /vsicurl/https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/podaac-ops-cumulus-protected/AVHRR_OI-NCEI-L4-GLOB-v2.1/20191231120000-NCEI-L4_GHRSST-SSTblend-AVHRR_OI-GLOB-v02.0-fv02.1.nc

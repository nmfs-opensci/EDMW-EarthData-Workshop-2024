# Running from Google Colab

The standard [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) has most of the packages you will need. For most of the tutorials, you only need to install `earthaccess` with 

`!pip install earthaccess`

# Running from a Docker file

The easiest way to run the Python tutorials locally is to use the Docker container `py-rocket-geospatial`; this has JupyterLab and the conda environment that is being used in the JupyterHub. You'll need containerization software such as [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) installed.


## Start the docker image

Make sure Docker or Podman is running (open the Desktop application), then run the container:

Windows, Linux or Intel-chip Mac:
```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888  ghcr.io/nmfs-opensci/container-images/py-rocket-geospatial:latest
```

Apple-chip Mac:
```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 --platform linux/amd64 ghcr.io/nmfs-opensci/container-images/py-rocket-geospatial:latest
```

::: {.callout-tip}
If you're using Podman, simply replace `docker` with `podman` in this command and any that follow.
:::

After `docker run` there will be a long printout in the terminal window, you will see instructions for how to access the server (`To access the server...`). Copy and paste either of the URLs into a web browser. You should be greeted with a JupyterLab dashboard as in the live demo. 

## Clone the tutorials

Clone and then cd into the repo. Open a terminal and run
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/EDMW-3B-tutorials
```

The Python tutorials are in the `tutorials/python` directory.

## Running R

*Note if you also want to run the R tutorials, see the instructions for R set-up. The `docker run` command is slightly different.*

## Connect your local files to image

Clone and then cd into the repo. Open a terminal and run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/EDMW-3B-tutorials
cd EDMW-3B-tutorials
```

Windows, Linux or Intel-chip Mac:
```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v /$(pwd):/home/jovyan/ ghcr.io/nmfs-opensci/container-images/py-rocket-geospatial:latest
```

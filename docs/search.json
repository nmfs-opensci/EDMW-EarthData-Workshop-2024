These data are often provided in GeoTIFF, NetCDF or HDF format with rich and useful metadata that we want to retain, or even use in our analysis. Common analyses include calculating means, standard deviations and anomalies over time or one or more spatial dimensions (e.g. zonal means). Model output often includes multiple variables that you want to apply similar analyses to.\n\n\n\nA schematic of multi-dimensional data\n\n\nThe schematic above shows a typical data structure for multi-dimensional data. There are two data cubes, one for temperature and one for precipitation. Common coordinate variables, in this case latitude, longitude and time are associated with each variable. Each variable, including coordinate variables, will have a set of attributes: name, units, missing value, etc. The file containing the data may also have attributes: source of the data, model name coordinate reference system if the data are projected. Writing code using low-level packages such as netcdf4 and numpy to read the data, then perform analysis, and write the results to file is time consuming and prone to errors.",

I’ll extract temperatures for the state of Colorado. The bounding box for the state is [-109 E, -102 E, 37 N, 41 N].\nIn the code below, pay attention to both the order of the coordinates and the range of values. The first value of the lat coordinate variable is 41 N, the second value is 37 N. Unfortunately, xarray expects slices of coordinates to be in the same order as the coordinates. Note lon is 0 to 360 not -180 to 180, and I let python calculate it for me within the slice.\n\nds.air.sel(lat=slice(41.,37.), lon=slice(360-109,360-102))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;xarray.DataArray 'air' (time: 2920, lat: 2, lon: 3)&gt;\narray([[[-10.049988 ,  -9.25     ,  -8.75     ],\n        [ -6.25     ,  -6.549988 ,  -6.3599854]],\n\n       [[-18.149994 , -14.950012 ,  -9.950012 ],\n        [-13.649994 , -11.049988 ,  -7.25     ]],\n\n       [[-20.449997 , -18.649994 , -13.359985 ],\n        [-19.350006 , -16.950012 , -11.25     ]],\n\n       ...,\n\n       [[-24.460007 , -28.259995 , -25.759995 ],\n        [-16.959991 , -24.059998 , -24.059998 ]],\n\n       [[-24.36     , -26.160004 , -23.460007 ],\n        [-15.959991 , -22.86     , -22.960007 ]],\n\n       [[-17.559998 , -15.359985 , -13.660004 ],\n        [-13.76001  , -15.959991 , -14.459991 ]]], dtype=float32)\nCoordinates:\n  * lat      (lat) float32 40.0 37.5\n  * lon      (lon) float32 252.5 255.0 257.5\n  * time     (time) datetime64[ns] 2013-01-01 ... 2014-12-31T18:00:00\nAttributes:\n    long_name:     4xDaily Air temperature at sigma level 995\n    units:         degC\n    precision:     2\n    GRIB_id:       11\n    GRIB_name:     TMP\n    var_desc:      Air temperature\n    dataset:       NMC Reanalysis\n    level_desc:    Surface\n    statistic:     Individual Obs\n    parent_stat:   Other\n    actual_range:  [185.16 322.1 ]xarray.DataArray'air'time: 2920lat: 2lon: 3-10.05 -9.25 -8.75 -6.25 -6.55 ... -15.36 -13.66 -13.76 -15.96 -14.46array([[[-10.049988 ,  -9.25     ,  -8.75     ],\n        [ -6.25     ,  -6.549988 ,  -6.3599854]],\n\n       [[-18.149994 , -14.950012 ,  -9.950012 ],\n        [-13.649994 , -11.049988 ,  -7.25     ]],\n\n       [[-20.449997 , -18.649994 , -13.359985 ],\n        [-19.350006 , -16.950012 , -11.25     ]],\n\n       ...,\n\n       [[-24.460007 , -28.259995 , -25.759995 ],\n        [-16.959991 , -24.059998 , -24.059998 ]],\n\n       [[-24.36     , -26.160004 , -23.460007 ],\n        [-15.959991 , -22.86     , -22.960007 ]],\n\n       [[-17.559998 , -15.359985 , -13.660004 ],\n        [-13.76001  , -15.959991 , -14.459991 ]]], dtype=float32)Coordinates: (3)lat(lat)float3240.0 37.5standard_name :latitudelong_name :Latitudeunits :degrees_northaxis :Yarray([40. , 37.5], dtype=float32)lon(lon)float32252.5 255.0 257.5standard_name :longitudelong_name :Longitudeunits :degrees_eastaxis :Xarray([252.5, 255. , 257.5], dtype=float32)time(time)datetime64[ns]2013-01-01 ... 2014-12-31T18:00:00standard_name :timelong_name :Timearray(['2013-01-01T00:00:00.000000000', '2013-01-01T06:00:00.000000000',\n       '2013-01-01T12:00:00.000000000', ..., '2014-12-31T06:00:00.000000000',\n       '2014-12-31T12:00:00.000000000', '2014-12-31T18:00:00.000000000'],\n      dtype='datetime64[ns]')Attributes: (11)long_name :4xDaily Air temperature at sigma level 995units :degCprecision :2GRIB_id :11GRIB_name :TMPvar_desc :Air temperaturedataset :NMC Reanalysislevel_desc :Surfacestatistic :Individual Obsparent_stat :Otheractual_range :[185.16 322.1 ]\n\n\nWhat if we want temperature for a point, for example Denver, CO (39.72510678889283 N, -104.98785545855408 E). xarray can handle this!

For the default options, select file type as .nc (NetCDF3-binary file) and click ‘Just generate the URL,’ you can see the URL is then https://apdrc.soest.hawaii.edu/erddap/griddap/hawaii_soest_66d3_10d8_0f3c.nc?u[(2023-04-01T00:00:00Z):1:(2023-04-01T00:00:00Z)][(10.0):1:(1000.0)][(-90.0):1:(90.0)][(0.0):1:(359.75)],v[(2023-04-01T00:00:00Z):1:(2023-04-01T00:00:00Z)][(10.0):1:(1000.0)][(-90.0):1:(90.0)][(0.0):1:(359.75)] and it follows this template:\n\nhttps://apdrc.soest.hawaii.edu/erddap/griddap\n\n/DATASET_ID.FILE_EXTENSION\nfollowing by\nVARIABLE_NAME1 [(START_DIM1):STRIDE_DIM1:(STOP_DIM1)][(START_DIM2):STRIDE_DIM2:(STOP_DIM2)][(START_DIM3):STRIDE_DIM3:(STOP_DIM3)]…\nand then\nVARIABLE_NAME2[(START_DIM1):STRIDE_DIM1:(STOP_DIM1)][(START_DIM2):STRIDE_DIM2:(STOP_DIM2)][(START_DIM3):STRIDE_DIM3:(STOP_DIM3)]…\nand so on for all the variables. To illustrate this template, you can liken it to downloading every variable as an Xarray DataArray, and combine them together based on the coordinates. In the URL above, the order and specifications of the dimension slicing options must be the consistent for all variables, just like how Xarray combining by coords only works if the coordinates are so.\nThe template is also well-explained in GRIDDAP documentation.\nWe can all agree that trying to write down every template for different datasets is error-prone and tedious, so you are more than welcome to copy and modify your template using the original file generator Python formatted strings to help with generating URLs for downloads. Since URLs vary greatly form dataset to dataset, there is no ideal URL template to consider, but we will still develop a function to generalize the URL generator to the best of my knowledge.\nNOTE: for the URL template, we focus on downloading smaller chunks of the dataset, sliced temporally just like downloading from the EarthData database so that the remote server would not be broken handling the request. We also recommend you to download variables together in one NetCDF3 file (multiple variable names in one URL) instead of individual variables as it takes time piecing them all together.",

Include whether you are looking for teammates to join this project. Others who are interested can respond in a thread.\nWe welcome a broad range of project topics. People often use project time to dig deeper into concepts introduced in tutorials, to explore problems within their own research, or to advance community data sharing and software building efforts.\nThe course team is here to help you get clear on project ideas and decide on what is possible within 5 days.\n\nAt the end of week 1 of the course we will have a “Pitchfest”” where proposer(s) can pitch their idea. At this time we will finalize the project teams for the week — however we will provide times when team members will move and work with other teams. This kind of ‘cross-pollination’ helps everyone learn and solve problems.\nTeam hacktime will begin on week 2.\nEach team is encouraged to identify a project lead, likely the person who pitched the idea, who has knowledge of the datasets and the specific problem to be explored. But roles can be assigned as the group decides to best fit skills and needs.\nOn the final day of the course, each team will present their work in a series of lightning talks."

Hackweeks help individuals and teams engage more effectively in open and reproducible science. - eScience Institute, University of Washington, Seattle USA\nThe hackweek model has become a vital tool in the data science community, fostering idea exchange through modern data analysis workflow training. Unlike traditional academic events, hackweeks offer intensive, interactive learning, including tutorials on cutting-edge methods, peer-based learning, and collaborative on-site projects. Unlike hackathons, which emphasize software development, hackweeks prioritize education and open-ended projects, benefiting fields needing both expertise and efficient computational workflows for idea exchange and discovery.

Remember `git` is a program that keeps track of your changes locally (on 2i2c JupyterHub or your own computer) and github.com is a platform to host your repositories. However, since your changes are tracked by `git`, the email/name used in git configuration will show up next to your contributions on github.com when you `push` your repository to github.com (`git push` is discussed in a later step).\n\nConfigure git to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in Step 5, we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)\ngit config --global credential.helper store\nCopy link for the demo repository from your github account. Click the green “Code” button and copy the link as shown.\n\nClone the repository using git clone command in the terminal\nTo clone a repository from github, copy the link for the repository (previous step) and use git clone:\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/check_github_setup\nNote: Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME here with your github.com username. For example, it is virdi for my github.com account as seen in this image.\n\nUse ls (list files) to verify the existence of the repository that you just cloned\n\nChange directory to the cloned repository using cd check_github_setup and check the current directory using pwd command (present working directory)\n\nCheck status of your git repository to confirm git set up using git status\n\nYou are all set with using git on your 2i2c JupyterHub! But the collaborative power of git through github needs some additional setup.\nIn the next step, we will create a new file in this repository, track changes to this file, and link it with your github.com account.\n\n\nStep 4. Creating new file and tracking changes\n\nIn the left panel on your 2i2c JupyterHub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “check_github_setup” directory.\n\n\nOnce you are in the check_github_setup directory, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Text File).\n\nName the file lastname.txt. For example, virdi.txt for me (use your last name). Add some content to this file (for example, I added this to my virdi.txt file: my last name is virdi).\n\nNow you should have a new file (lastname.txt) in the git repository directory check_github_setup\nCheck if git can see that you have added a new file using git status. Git reports that you have a new file that is not tracked by git yet, and suggests adding that file to the git tracking system.\n\nAs seen in this image, git suggests adding that file so it can be tracked for changes. You can add file to git for tracking changes using git add. Then, you can commit changes to this file’s content using git commit as shown in the image.\ngit add virdi.txt\ngit status\ngit commit -m \"adding a new file\"\ngit status\n\nAs seen in the image above, git is suggesting to push the change that you just committed to the remote server at github.com (so that your collaborators can also see what changes you made).\nNote: DO NOT execute push yet. Before we push to github.com, let’s configure git further and store our github.com credentials to avoid entering the credentials every time we invoke git push. For doing so, we need to create a token on github.com to be used in place of your github.com password.\n\n\n\nStep 5. Create access token on github.com\n\nGo to your github account and create a new “personal access token”: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new\n\nEnter a description in “Note” field as seen above, select “repo” checkbox, and scroll to the bottom and click the green button “Generate Token”. Once generated, copy the token (or save it in a text file for reference).\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nTo push (transfer) your changes to github, use git push in terminal. It requires you to enter your github credentials. You will be prompted to enter your github username and “password”. When prompted for your “password”, DO NOT use your github password, use the github token that was copied in the previous step.\ngit push\n\nNote: When you paste your token in the terminal window, windows users will press Ctrl+V and mac os users will press Cmd+V. If it does not work, try generating another token and use the copy icon next to the token to copy the token. Then, paste using your computer’s keyboard shortcut for paste.\nNow your password is stored in ~/.git-credentials and you will not be prompted again unless the Github token expires. You can check the presence of this git-credentials file using Terminal.

    "text": "Introduction :: Version Control (Git)\n\nWhat is version control, git, github, and how to set it up?\nVersion control is managing and tracking changes to your documents (program source code, images, websites, data files, etc.). git is a popular tool used for version control of software code. github.com is popular platform that provides remote server hosting for git repositories. A repository is a collection of various files that you are tracking for changes and versions. Currently GitHub is the most popular platform for file sharing code and code packages.\nThis section is a step-by-step guide to set up git on our JupyterHub. We will also configure git to use your github.com account for managing your repositories hosted on github.com. There are 5 main steps.\n\n\nStep 1: Create a GitHub account\nTo complete the setup, you will need an account on github.com. If you don’t have an account, please visit github.com, create an account (free) and come back to this guide for setting up git.\n\n\nStep 2: Clone a repository\nWe have created a demo repository for you to clone:\nhttps://github.com/nmfs-opensci/Git-Lesson\n\nStart your JupyterHub\nClick on the Git icon\n\n\n\nClick “Clone a Repository”\nWhere is says “Enter the URI of the remote Git repository”, paste in the URL https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/Git-Lesson\nThe folder appears and you can enter the folder and edit and create files.\n\n\nYour task: Create a file with your name and save to the Git-Lesson folder"

    "text": "Step 3:\nConfigure git with your name and email address.\n``` bash\ngit config --global user.name \"Makhan Virdi\"\ngit config --global user.email \"Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\"\n```\n\n**Note:** This name and email could be different from your github.com credentials. Remember `git` is a program that keeps track of your changes locally (on 2i2c JupyterHub or your own computer) and github.com is a platform to host your repositories. However, since your changes are tracked by `git`, the email/name used in git configuration will show up next to your contributions on github.com when you `push` your repository to github.com (`git push` is discussed in a later step).\n\nConfigure git to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in Step 5, we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)\ngit config --global credential.helper store\nCopy link for the demo repository from your github account. Click the green “Code” button and copy the link as shown.\n\nClone the repository using git clone command in the terminal\nTo clone a repository from github, copy the link for the repository (previous step) and use git clone:\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/check_github_setup\nNote: Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME here with your github.com username. For example, it is virdi for my github.com account as seen in this image.\n\nUse ls (list files) to verify the existence of the repository that you just cloned\n\nChange directory to the cloned repository using cd check_github_setup and check the current directory using pwd command (present working directory)\n\nCheck status of your git repository to confirm git set up using git status\n\nYou are all set with using git on your 2i2c JupyterHub! But the collaborative power of git through github needs some additional setup.\nIn the next step, we will create a new file in this repository, track changes to this file, and link it with your github.com account.\n\n\nStep 4. Creating new file and tracking changes\n\nIn the left panel on your 2i2c JupyterHub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “check_github_setup” directory.\n\n\nOnce you are in the check_github_setup directory, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Text File).\n\nName the file lastname.txt. For example, virdi.txt for me (use your last name). Add some content to this file (for example, I added this to my virdi.txt file: my last name is virdi).\n\nNow you should have a new file (lastname.txt) in the git repository directory check_github_setup\nCheck if git can see that you have added a new file using git status. Git reports that you have a new file that is not tracked by git yet, and suggests adding that file to the git tracking system.\n\nAs seen in this image, git suggests adding that file so it can be tracked for changes. You can add file to git for tracking changes using git add. Then, you can commit changes to this file’s content using git commit as shown in the image.\ngit add virdi.txt\ngit status\ngit commit -m \"adding a new file\"\ngit status\n\nAs seen in the image above, git is suggesting to push the change that you just committed to the remote server at github.com (so that your collaborators can also see what changes you made).\nNote: DO NOT execute push yet. Before we push to github.com, let’s configure git further and store our github.com credentials to avoid entering the credentials every time we invoke git push. For doing so, we need to create a token on github.com to be used in place of your github.com password.\n\n\n\nStep 5. Create access token on github.com\n\nGo to your github account and create a new “personal access token”: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new\n\nEnter a description in “Note” field as seen above, select “repo” checkbox, and scroll to the bottom and click the green button “Generate Token”. Once generated, copy the token (or save it in a text file for reference).\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nTo push (transfer) your changes to github, use git push in terminal. It requires you to enter your github credentials. You will be prompted to enter your github username and “password”. When prompted for your “password”, DO NOT use your github password, use the github token that was copied in the previous step.\ngit push\n\nNote: When you paste your token in the terminal window, windows users will press Ctrl+V and mac os users will press Cmd+V. If it does not work, try generating another token and use the copy icon next to the token to copy the token. Then, paste using your computer’s keyboard shortcut for paste.\nNow your password is stored in ~/.git-credentials and you will not be prompted again unless the Github token expires. You can check the presence of this git-credentials file using Terminal. Here the ~ character represents your home directory (/home/jovyan/).\nls -la ~\nThe output looks like this:\ndrwxr-xr-x 13 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 22 17:35 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root   root   4096 Oct  4 16:21 ..\n-rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan 1754 Oct 29 18:30 .bash_history\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 29 16:38 .config\n-rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan   66 Oct 22 17:35 .git-credentials\n-rw-r--r--  1 jovyan jovyan   84 Oct 22 17:14 .gitconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 10 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 21 16:19 2021-Cloud-Hackathon\nYou can also verify your git configuration\n(notebook) jovyan@jupyter-virdi:~$ git config -l\nThe output should have credential.helper = store:\nuser.email        = Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\nuser.name         = Makhan Virdi\ncredential.helper = store\n\nNow we are all set to collaborate with github on the JupyterHub during the Cloud Hackathon!\n\n\nSummary: Git Commands\n\nCommonly used git commands (modified from source)\n\n\nGit Command\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngit status\nShows the current state of the repository: the current working branch, files in the staging area, etc.\n\n\ngit add\nAdds a new, previously untracked file to version control and marks already tracked files to be committed with the next commit\n\n\ngit commit\nSaves the current state of the repository and creates an entry in the log\n\n\ngit log\nShows the history for the repository\n\n\ngit diff\nShows content differences between commits, branches, individual files and more\n\n\ngit clone\nCopies a repository to your local environment, including all the history\n\n\ngit pull\nGets the latest changes of a previously cloned repository\n\n\ngit push\nPushes your local changes to the remote repository, sharing them with others\n\n\n\n\n\nGit: More Details\nLesson: For a more detailed self-paced lesson on git, visit Git Lesson from Software Carpentry\nCheatsheet: Frequently used git commands\nDangit, Git!?!: If you are stuck after a git mishap, there are ready-made solutions to common problems at Dangit, Git!?!\n\n\nCloning our repository using the git Jupyter lab extension.\nIf we’re already familiar with git commands and feel more confortable using a GUI our Jupyterhub deployment comes with a git extension.

Let’s practice making new files in RStudio.\n\nR Script\n\nOpen RStudio\nIn the upper right, make sure you are in your sandbox project.\nFrom the file panel, click on “New Blank File” and create a new R script.\nPaste\n\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n1+1\nin the script. 7. Click the Source button (upper left of your new script file) to run this code. 8. Try putting your cursor on one line and running that line of code by clicking “Run” 9. Try selecting lines of code and running that by clicking “Run”\n\n\ncsv file\n\nFrom the file panel, click on “New Blank File” and create a Text File.\nThe file will open in the top left corner. Paste in the following:\n\nname, place, value\nA, 1, 2\nB, 10, 20\nC, 100, 200\n\nClick the save icon (above your new file) to save your csv file\n\n\n\nA Rmarkdown document\nNow let’s create some more complicated files using the RStudio template feature.\n\nFrom the upper left, click File -&gt; New File -&gt; RMarkdown\nClick “Ok” at the bottom.\nWhen the file opens, click Knit (icon at top of file).\nIt will ask for a name. Give it one and save.\nYou file will render into html.\n\nReference sheet for writing in RMarkdown or go to Help &gt; Markdown Quick Reference\n\n\nA Rmarkdown presentation\n\nFrom the upper left, click File -&gt; New File -&gt; RMarkdown\nClick “Presentation” on left of the popup and click “Ok” at the bottom.\nWhen the file opens, click Knit (icon at top of file).\nIt will ask for a name. Give it one and save.\nYou file will render into html.\n\n\n\n(advanced) An interactive application\n\nFrom the upper left, click File -&gt; New File -&gt; Shiny Web App\nIn the popup, give the app a name and make sure the app is saved to my-files\nWhen the file opens, Run App (icon at top of file).\n\n\n\nAnd many more\nPlay around with creating other types of documents using templates. Especially if you already use RStudio.",

    "text": "Introduction :: Version Control (Git)\n\nWhat is version control, git, github, and how to set it up?\nVersion control is managing and tracking changes to your documents (program source code, images, websites, data files, etc.). git is a popular tool used for version control of software code. github.com is popular platform that provides remote server hosting for git repositories. A repository is a collection of various files that you are tracking for changes and versions. Currently GitHub is the most popular platform for file sharing code and code packages.\nThis section is a step-by-step guide to set up git on our JupyterHub. We will also configure git to use your github.com account for managing your repositories hosted on github.com. There are 5 main steps.\n\n\nStep 1: Create a GitHub account\nTo complete the setup, you will need an account on github.com. If you don’t have an account, please visit github.com, create an account (free) and come back to this guide for setting up git.\n\n\nStep 2: Clone a repository\nWe have created a demo repository for you to clone:\nhttps://github.com/nmfs-opensci/Git-Lesson\n\nStart your JupyterHub\nClick on the Git icon\n\n\n\nClick “Clone a Repository”\nWhere it says “Enter the URI of the remote Git repository”, paste in the URL https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/Git-Lesson\nThe folder appears and you can enter the folder and edit and create files.\n\n\nYour task: Create a file with your name and save to the Git-Lesson folder"

    "text": "Step 3:\nConfigure git with your name and email address.\n``` bash\ngit config --global user.name \"Makhan Virdi\"\ngit config --global user.email \"Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\"\n```\n\n**Note:** This name and email could be different from your github.com credentials. Remember `git` is a program that keeps track of your changes locally (on the JupyterHub or your own computer) and github.com is a platform to host your repositories. However, since your changes are tracked by `git`, the email/name used in git configuration will show up next to your contributions on github.com when you `push` your repository to github.com (`git push` is discussed in a later step).\n\nConfigure git to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in Step 5, we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)\ngit config --global credential.helper store\nCopy link for the demo repository from your github account. Click the green “Code” button and copy the link as shown.\n\nClone the repository using git clone command in the terminal\nTo clone a repository from github, copy the link for the repository (previous step) and use git clone:\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/check_github_setup\nNote: Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME here with your github.com username. For example, it is virdi for my github.com account as seen in this image.\n\nUse ls (list files) to verify the existence of the repository that you just cloned\n\nChange directory to the cloned repository using cd check_github_setup and check the current directory using pwd command (present working directory)\n\nCheck status of your git repository to confirm git set up using git status\n\nYou are all set with using git on your 2i2c JupyterHub! But the collaborative power of git through github needs some additional setup.\nIn the next step, we will create a new file in this repository, track changes to this file, and link it with your github.com account.\n\n\nStep 4. Creating new file and tracking changes\n\nIn the left panel on your 2i2c JupyterHub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “check_github_setup” directory.\n\n\nOnce you are in the check_github_setup directory, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Text File).\n\nName the file lastname.txt. For example, virdi.txt for me (use your last name). Add some content to this file (for example, I added this to my virdi.txt file: my last name is virdi).\n\nNow you should have a new file (lastname.txt) in the git repository directory check_github_setup\nCheck if git can see that you have added a new file using git status. Git reports that you have a new file that is not tracked by git yet, and suggests adding that file to the git tracking system.\n\nAs seen in this image, git suggests adding that file so it can be tracked for changes. You can add file to git for tracking changes using git add. Then, you can commit changes to this file’s content using git commit as shown in the image.\ngit add virdi.txt\ngit status\ngit commit -m \"adding a new file\"\ngit status\n\nAs seen in the image above, git is suggesting to push the change that you just committed to the remote server at github.com (so that your collaborators can also see what changes you made).\nNote: DO NOT execute push yet. Before we push to github.com, let’s configure git further and store our github.com credentials to avoid entering the credentials every time we invoke git push. For doing so, we need to create a token on github.com to be used in place of your github.com password.\n\n\n\nStep 5. Create access token on github.com\n\nGo to your github account and create a new “personal access token”: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new\n\nEnter a description in “Note” field as seen above, select “repo” checkbox, and scroll to the bottom and click the green button “Generate Token”. Once generated, copy the token (or save it in a text file for reference).\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nTo push (transfer) your changes to github, use git push in terminal. It requires you to enter your github credentials. You will be prompted to enter your github username and “password”. When prompted for your “password”, DO NOT use your github password, use the github token that was copied in the previous step.\ngit push\n\nNote: When you paste your token in the terminal window, windows users will press Ctrl+V and mac os users will press Cmd+V. If it does not work, try generating another token and use the copy icon next to the token to copy the token. Then, paste using your computer’s keyboard shortcut for paste.\nNow your password is stored in ~/.git-credentials and you will not be prompted again unless the Github token expires. You can check the presence of this git-credentials file using Terminal. Here the ~ character represents your home directory (/home/jovyan/).\nls -la ~\nThe output looks like this:\ndrwxr-xr-x 13 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 22 17:35 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root   root   4096 Oct  4 16:21 ..\n-rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan 1754 Oct 29 18:30 .bash_history\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 29 16:38 .config\n-rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan   66 Oct 22 17:35 .git-credentials\n-rw-r--r--  1 jovyan jovyan   84 Oct 22 17:14 .gitconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 10 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 21 16:19 2021-Cloud-Hackathon\nYou can also verify your git configuration\n(notebook) jovyan@jupyter-virdi:~$ git config -l\nThe output should have credential.helper = store:\nuser.email        = Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\nuser.name         = Makhan Virdi\ncredential.helper = store\n\nNow we are all set to collaborate with github on the JupyterHub during the Cloud Hackathon!\n\n\nSummary: Git Commands\n\nCommonly used git commands (modified from source)\n\n\nGit Command\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngit status\nShows the current state of the repository: the current working branch, files in the staging area, etc.\n\n\ngit add\nAdds a new, previously untracked file to version control and marks already tracked files to be committed with the next commit\n\n\ngit commit\nSaves the current state of the repository and creates an entry in the log\n\n\ngit log\nShows the history for the repository\n\n\ngit diff\nShows content differences between commits, branches, individual files and more\n\n\ngit clone\nCopies a repository to your local environment, including all the history\n\n\ngit pull\nGets the latest changes of a previously cloned repository\n\n\ngit push\nPushes your local changes to the remote repository, sharing them with others\n\n\n\n\n\nGit: More Details\nLesson: For a more detailed self-paced lesson on git, visit Git Lesson from Software Carpentry\nCheatsheet: Frequently used git commands\nDangit, Git!?!: If you are stuck after a git mishap, there are ready-made solutions to common problems at Dangit, Git!?!\n\n\nCloning our repository using the git Jupyter lab extension.\nIf we’re already familiar with git commands and feel more confortable using a GUI our Jupyterhub deployment comes with a git extension.

    "section": "Introduction :: Version Control (Git and Github)",
    "text": "Introduction :: Version Control (Git and Github)\n\nWhat is version control, git, github, and how to set it up?\nVersion control is managing and tracking changes to your documents (program source code, images, websites, data files, etc.). git is a popular tool used for version control of software code. github.com is popular platform that provides remote server hosting for git repositories. A repository is a collection of various files that you are tracking for changes and versions (think of it as a directory with files that are being tracked for changes, using git for taking snapshots of versions as you are developing).\nThis section is a step-by-step guide to set up git on your 2i2c JupyterHub instance (referred to as 2i2c JupyterHub in these instruction). We will also configure git to use your github.com account for managing your repositories hosted on github.com. There are 5 main steps with substeps, includes instruction for addressing github’s new approach for token authentication.\n\n\nStep 1: Create a github account\nTo complete the setup, you will need an account on github.com. If you don’t have an account, please visit github.com, create an account (free) and come back to this guide for setting up git.\n\n\nStep 2: Fork a repository\nA fork is a copy of a repository from another github account (for example NASA-Openscapes account) to your github account (for example, my account virdi) that then you have permission to edit. To help you finish this setup correctly, we have created a demo repository on Openscapes github account named check_github_setup. You can fork this repository into your github account following these steps:\n\nLog in to your github.com account\nGo to the demo repository at NASA-Openscapes github\n\n\n\nDemo repository on NASA-Openscapes github\n\n\nClick on the fork icon in the top right corner, as shown in the image below and click your user name if prompted to do so\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Clone the repository that you just forked\nNow you have a fork of the demo repository in your github account that we can clone it in your 2i2c instance. In the code below, commands beginning with git is a git command for version control and synching; commands that don’t start with git are bash/linux/command line commands.\n\nStart your 2i2c JupyterHub and open a terminal\nFile &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Terminal\nMake sure you are in your home directory by usingpwd command and verifying the output as below\n/home/jovyan\n\nConfigure git with your name and email address.\ngit config --global user.name \"Makhan Virdi\"\ngit config --global user.email \"Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\"\nNote: This name and email could be different from your github.com credentials. Remember git is a program that keeps track of your changes locally (on 2i2c JupyterHub or your own computer) and github.com is a platform to host your repositories. However, since your changes are tracked by git, the email/name used in git configuration will show up next to your contributions on github.com when you push your repository to github.com (git push is discussed in a later step).\nConfigure git to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in Step 5, we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)\ngit config --global credential.helper store\nCopy link for the demo repository from your github account. Click the green “Code” button and copy the link as shown.\n\nClone the repository using git clone command in the terminal\nTo clone a repository from github, copy the link for the repository (previous step) and use git clone:\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/check_github_setup\nNote: Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME here with your github.com username. For example, it is virdi for my github.com account as seen in this image.\n\nUse ls (list files) to verify the existence of the repository that you just cloned\n\nChange directory to the cloned repository using cd check_github_setup and check the current directory using pwd command (present working directory)\n\nCheck status of your git repository to confirm git set up using git status\n\nYou are all set with using git on your 2i2c JupyterHub! But the collaborative power of git through github needs some additional setup.\nIn the next step, we will create a new file in this repository, track changes to this file, and link it with your github.com account.\n\n\n\nStep 4. Creating new file and tracking changes\n\nIn the left panel on your 2i2c JupyterHub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “check_github_setup” directory.\n\n\nOnce you are in the check_github_setup directory, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Text File).\n\nName the file lastname.txt. For example, virdi.txt for me (use your last name). Add some content to this file (for example, I added this to my virdi.txt file: my last name is virdi).\n\nNow you should have a new file (lastname.txt) in the git repository directory check_github_setup\nCheck if git can see that you have added a new file using git status. Git reports that you have a new file that is not tracked by git yet, and suggests adding that file to the git tracking system.\n\nAs seen in this image, git suggests adding that file so it can be tracked for changes. You can add file to git for tracking changes using git add. Then, you can commit changes to this file’s content using git commit as shown in the image.\ngit add virdi.txt\ngit status\ngit commit -m \"adding a new file\"\ngit status\n\nAs seen in the image above, git is suggesting to push the change that you just committed to the remote server at github.com (so that your collaborators can also see what changes you made).\nNote: DO NOT execute push yet. Before we push to github.com, let’s configure git further and store our github.com credentials to avoid entering the credentials every time we invoke git push. For doing so, we need to create a token on github.com to be used in place of your github.com password.\n\n\n\nStep 5. Create access token on github.com\n\nGo to your github account and create a new “personal access token”: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new\n\nEnter a description in “Note” field as seen above, select “repo” checkbox, and scroll to the bottom and click the green button “Generate Token”. Once generated, copy the token (or save it in a text file for reference).\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nTo push (transfer) your changes to github, use git push in terminal. It requires you to enter your github credentials. You will be prompted to enter your github username and “password”. When prompted for your “password”, DO NOT use your github password, use the github token that was copied in the previous step.\ngit push\n\nNote: When you paste your token in the terminal window, windows users will press Ctrl+V and mac os users will press Cmd+V. If it does not work, try generating another token and use the copy icon next to the token to copy the token. Then, paste using your computer’s keyboard shortcut for paste.\nNow your password is stored in ~/.git-credentials and you will not be prompted again unless the Github token expires. You can check the presence of this git-credentials file using Terminal. Here the ~ character represents your home directory (/home/jovyan/).\nls -la ~\nThe output looks like this:\ndrwxr-xr-x 13 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 22 17:35 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root   root   4096 Oct  4 16:21 ..\n-rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan 1754 Oct 29 18:30 .bash_history\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 29 16:38 .config\n-rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan   66 Oct 22 17:35 .git-credentials\n-rw-r--r--  1 jovyan jovyan   84 Oct 22 17:14 .gitconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 10 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 21 16:19 2021-Cloud-Hackathon\nYou can also verify your git configuration\n(notebook) jovyan@jupyter-virdi:~$ git config -l\nThe output should have credential.helper = store:\nuser.email        = Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\nuser.name         = Makhan Virdi\ncredential.helper = store\n\nNow we are all set to collaborate with github on the JupyterHub during the Cloud Hackathon!\n\n\nSummary: Git Commands\n\nCommonly used git commands (modified from source)\n\n\nGit Command\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngit status\nShows the current state of the repository: the current working branch, files in the staging area, etc.\n\n\ngit add\nAdds a new, previously untracked file to version control and marks already tracked files to be committed with the next commit\n\n\ngit commit\nSaves the current state of the repository and creates an entry in the log\n\n\ngit log\nShows the history for the repository\n\n\ngit diff\nShows content differences between commits, branches, individual files and more\n\n\ngit clone\nCopies a repository to your local environment, including all the history\n\n\ngit pull\nGets the latest changes of a previously cloned repository\n\n\ngit push\nPushes your local changes to the remote repository, sharing them with others\n\n\n\n\n\nGit: More Details\nLesson: For a more detailed self-paced lesson on git, visit Git Lesson from Software Carpentry\nCheatsheet: Frequently used git commands\nDangit, Git!?!: If you are stuck after a git mishap, there are ready-made solutions to common problems at Dangit, Git!?!\n\n\nCloning our repository using the git Jupyter lab extension.\nIf we’re already familiar with git commands and feel more confortable using a GUI our Jupyterhub deployment comes with a git extension.

    "text": "Background\nStudy of coastal upwelling dynamics using image machine-learning algorithms applied to remote-sensing data PI: Eli Holmes, Northwest Fisheries Science Center, NOAA Fisheries, Seattle WA\nCoastal upwelling is a key driver of productive fisheries. It is largely driven by coastal winds that produce wind stress perpendicular to the coast. This wind stress pulls surface water away from the coast and pulls deep, cold, nutrient rich water to the surface. Strong and consistent coastal upwelling happens in specific regions around the world and supports strong fisheries in these regions. An interesting and curious aspect of upwelling is that it is influenced by ocean-atmosphere teleconnections—correlations in ocean climate across long-distances. In plain language, it means that a pattern that arises in one part of the world’s oceans will be seen later on the other side of the world in a very different part of the world. One of these teleconnections is between temperature anomalies in the North Atlantic Ocean and coastal upwelling in the Arabian Sea.\n\nIn this project, we are exploring the use of machine learning and image machine learning to study relationships between coastal upwelling and the physical oceanography of the Arabian Sea. The goal is to explore whether these approaches provide a promising way to develop predictive models for upwelling intensity. For the project, we are using Python libraries for implementing neural networks with image inputs, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras."

For cloud-hosted datasets (which is what this tutorial best works with), we choose to download granules to the local machine instead of streaming them to the working Python scripts as some users may not be physically available in the us-west region for streaming to be effective. Local downloading may result in heavy file sizes, but is consistent, and we am also providing some tweaks to save as much as you can, especially if your research interest area requires a long temporal range and does not cover globally.\n\n# Log in using .netrc file\nauth = earthaccess.login(strategy=\"netrc\")\n\nWe are already authenticated with NASA EDL",

    "text": "Download granules for an extended period of time\nSince you cannot slice data spatially, downloading granules is going to take up a lot of disk space if you only need data within a small bounding box. For our task, we wrote a simple function to slice data and wrote it into a new file.\nYou can consult the earthacess library website or their notebooks for code snippets on how to browse and look up collections. For this notebook, we mainly focus on the downloading aspect. First, we need to get the list of granules to download.\nSince earthacess does not support spatial slicing, we developed a method to download, slice, combine, and export data yearly, then finally delete temporary downloaded files to save disk space. Assumed that you already knew the temporal, spatial range of the dataset of your chosen, we first download the data by year into a temporary folder, then slice the data and then export the combined data to another folder.\n\n# Our approach\n# Month end not included\n\ndef download_and_combine_granules(short_name, month_start, month_end, lat1=5, lat2=25, lon1=60, lon2=80):\n    for month in pd.date_range(month_start, month_end, freq='M').strftime('%Y-%m-%d'):      \n        print('Collecting granules')\n        granules = earthaccess.granule_query().short_name(short_name).temporal(f'{month[:7]}-01',month).get(366)\n        \n        MAIN_FOLDER = 'demonstrated data/earth_data'\n        TEMP_FOLDER = 'temp'\n        path_temp_folder = os.path.join(MAIN_FOLDER, TEMP_FOLDER)\n        path_processed_folder = os.path.join(MAIN_FOLDER, short_name)\n        # create folder to store data\n        if not os.path.exists(path_temp_folder):\n            os.makedirs(path_temp_folder)\n        if not os.path.exists(path_processed_folder):\n            os.makedirs(path_processed_folder)\n        files = earthaccess.download(granules, path_temp_folder)\n       \n        \n        ## if dataset coordinates are slice-able, use:\n        print('Slicing...')\n        data = xr.open_mfdataset(f'{path_temp_folder}/*.nc').sel(lat=slice(lat1, lat2), lon=slice(lon1, lon2))\n    \n        \n        # combine files together \n        ## for some collections, coordinate names are 'lat' and 'lon' while their underlying indices are 'latitude' and 'longitude', respectively\n        ## may or may not be applicable for other datasets on the site.\n        ## get bounding box if not sliceable\n        ### lat1_idx, lat2_idx, lon1_idx, lon2_idx = get_bounding_box(os.path.join(path_temp_folder, first_file), lat1, lat2, lon1, lon2)\n        ### data = xr.open_mfdataset(f'{path_temp_folder}/*.nc').isel(latitude=slice(lat1_idx, lat2_idx+1), longitude=slice(lon1_idx, lon2_idx+1))\n        \n        data.to_netcdf(f'{path_processed_folder}/{month}.nc')\n        \n        # delete files in the temporary folder\n        print('Deleting temporary files...')\n        files = glob.glob(f'{path_temp_folder}/*.*')\n        for f in files:\n            os.remove(f)\n\ndef get_bounding_box(file_path, lat1=0, lat2=30, lon1=60, lon2=80):\n    \"\"\"\n    The dataset we experimented did not have indexed coordinates, \n    so we resorted to slicing using index positions\n    \"\"\"\n    ds = xr.open_dataset(file_path)\n    \n    lat_vals = ds.lat.values\n    lon_vals = ds.lon.values\n    \n    lat1_idx = np.abs(lat_vals-lat1).argmin()\n    lat2_idx = np.abs(lat_vals-lat2).argmin()\n    lon1_idx = np.abs(lon_vals-lon1).argmin()\n    lon2_idx = np.abs(lon_vals-lon1).argmin()\n    \n    return lat1_idx, lat2_idx, lon1_idx, lon2_idx\n\n\n# download and combine every month's worth of data\ndownload_and_combine_granules(short_name='MUR25-JPL-L4-GLOB-v04.2',\n                          month_start='2003-01', month_end='2003-03', \n                          lat1=5, lat2=25, lon1=60, lon2=80)\n\nCollecting granules\n Getting 31 granules, approx download size: 0.0 GB\nSlicing...\nDeleting temporary files...\nCollecting granules\n Getting 28 granules, approx download size: 0.0 GB\nSlicing...\nDeleting temporary files...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlist_of_missing_dates = [\"2003-01-04\", \"2003-01-18\", \"2003-02-18\"]\n\nfor date in list_of_missing_dates:\n    result = earthaccess.search_data(\n        short_name='MUR-JPL-L4-GLOB-v4.1',\n        cloud_hosted=True,\n        bounding_box = (60, 5, 80, 25),\n        temporal=(date, date)\n    )\n    \n    MAIN_FOLDER = 'demonstrated data/earth_data'\n    TEMP_FOLDER = 'temp'\n    path_temp_folder = os.path.join(MAIN_FOLDER, TEMP_FOLDER)\n    file = earthaccess.download(result, path_temp_folder)\n\nGranules found: 1\n Getting 1 granules, approx download size: 0.0 GB\nError while downloading the file 20030218090000-JPL-L4_GHRSST-SSTfnd-MUR-GLOB-v02.0-fv04.1.nc\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.9/site-packages/earthaccess/store.py\", line 488, in _download_file\n    r.raise_for_status()\n  File \"/srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.9/site-packages/requests/models.py\", line 960, in raise_for_status\n    raise HTTPError(http_error_msg, response=self)\nrequests.exceptions.HTTPError: 502 Server Error: Bad Gateway for url: https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/podaac-ops-cumulus-protected/MUR-JPL-L4-GLOB-v4.1/20030218090000-JPL-L4_GHRSST-SSTfnd-MUR-GLOB-v02.0-fv04.1.nc",

    "text": "Why do we need xarray?\nAs Geoscientists, we often work with time series of data with two or more dimensions: a time series of calibrated, orthorectified satellite images; two-dimensional grids of surface air temperature from an atmospheric reanalysis; or three-dimensional (level, x, y) cubes of ocean salinity from an ocean model. These data are often provided in GeoTIFF, NetCDF or HDF format with rich and useful metadata that we want to retain, or even use in our analysis. Common analyses include calculating means, standard deviations and anomalies over time or one or more spatial dimensions (e.g. zonal means). Model output often includes multiple variables that you want to apply similar analyses to.\n\n\n\nA schematic of multi-dimensional data\n\n\nThe schematic above shows a typical data structure for multi-dimensional data. There are two data cubes, one for temperature and one for precipitation. Common coordinate variables, in this case latitude, longitude and time are associated with each variable. Each variable, including coordinate variables, will have a set of attributes: name, units, missing value, etc. The file containing the data may also have attributes: source of the data, model name coordinate reference system if the data are projected. Writing code using low-level packages such as netcdf4 and numpy to read the data, then perform analysis, and write the results to file is time consuming and prone to errors."

We’ll follow convention by giving the module the shortname xr\n\nimport xarray as xr\nxr.set_options(keep_attrs=True)\n\nI’m going to use one of xarray’s tutorial datasets. In this case, air temperature from the NCEP reanalysis. I’ll assign the result of the open_dataset to ds. I may change this to access a dataset directly\n\nds = xr.tutorial.open_dataset(\"air_temperature\")\n\nAs we are in an interactive environment, we can just type ds to see what we have.\n\nds\n\nFirst thing to notice is that ds is an xarray.Dataset object. It has dimensions, lat, lon, and time. It also has coordinate variables with the same names as these dimensions. These coordinate variables are 1-dimensional. This is a NetCDF convention. The Dataset contains one data variable, air. This has dimensions (time, lat, lon).\nClicking on the document icon reveals attributes for each variable. Clicking on the disk icon reveals a representation of the data.\nEach of the data and coordinate variables can be accessed and examined using the variable name as a key.\n\nds.air\n\n\nds['air']\n\nThese are xarray.DataArray objects. This is the basic building block for xarray.\nVariables can also be accessed as attributes of ds.\n\nds.time\n\nA major difference between accessing a variable as an attribute versus using a key is that the attribute is read-only but the key method can be used to update the variable. For example, if I want to convert the units of air from Kelvin to degrees Celsius.\n\nds['air'] = ds.air - 273.15\n\nThis approach can also be used to add new variables\n\nds['air_kelvin'] = ds.air + 273.15\n\nIt is helpful to update attributes such as units, this saves time, confusion and mistakes, especially when you save the dataset.\n\nds['air'].attrs['units'] = 'degC'\n\n\nds"

    "section": "Subsetting and Indexing",
    "text": "Subsetting and Indexing\nSubsetting and indexing methods depend on whether you are working with a Dataset or DataArray. A DataArray can be accessed using positional indexing just like a numpy array. To access the temperature field for the first time step, you do the following.\n\nds['air'][0,:,:]\n\nNote this returns a DataArray with coordinates but not attributes.\nHowever, the real power is being able to access variables using coordinate variables. I can get the same subset using the following. (It’s also more explicit about what is being selected and robust in case I modify the DataArray and expect the same output.)\n\nds['air'].sel(time='2013-01-01').time\n\n\nds.air.sel(time='2013-01-01')\n\nI can also do slices. I’ll extract temperatures for the state of Colorado. The bounding box for the state is [-109 E, -102 E, 37 N, 41 N].\nIn the code below, pay attention to both the order of the coordinates and the range of values. The first value of the lat coordinate variable is 41 N, the second value is 37 N. Unfortunately, xarray expects slices of coordinates to be in the same order as the coordinates. Note lon is 0 to 360 not -180 to 180, and I let python calculate it for me within the slice.\n\nds.air.sel(lat=slice(41.,37.), lon=slice(360-109,360-102))\n\nWhat if we want temperature for a point, for example Denver, CO (39.72510678889283 N, -104.98785545855408 E). xarray can handle this! If we just want data from the nearest grid point, we can use sel and specify the method as “nearest”.\n\ndenver_lat, denver_lon = 39.72510678889283, -104.98785545855408\n\n\nds.air.sel(lat=denver_lat, lon=360+denver_lon, method='nearest')\n\nIf we want to interpolate, we can use interp(). In this case I use linear or bilinear interpolation.\ninterp() can also be used to resample data to a new grid and even reproject data\n\nds.air.interp(lat=denver_lat, lon=360+denver_lon, method='linear')\n\nsel() and interp() can also be used on Dataset objects.\n\nds.sel(lat=slice(41.,37.), lon=slice(360-109,360-102))\n\n\nds.interp(lat=denver_lat, lon=360+denver_lon, method='linear')"

Use “only show code” if you don’t want all the narrative.\nIn order to work with ChatGPT, you need to be able to tell it what your data look like. Core commands you need to know:\n\nClass class(object)\nColumn names colnames(object)\nSize dim(object)\n\nUse these commands to learn what to tell ChatGPT.\nYou learned how to ask ChatGPT to help you plot and how to tell it what the problems are so it can help you. You learned about the mapview R package. ChatGPT knows about it, but rarely will it suggest it on it’s own.\nYou made a (boring) plot with the ggplot2 plotting package. This is part of the tidyverse. It is 2023, we use ggplot2 for plotting not base R (plot()). We will cover much more plotting with ggplot2 in another tutorial.",
